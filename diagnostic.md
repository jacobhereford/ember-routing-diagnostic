# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
    the main tasks are changing of view states.  switching from view state to view
    state
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember g route campus/boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md
    {{#link-to 'campus.boston'}}Boston{{/link-to}}
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    ```md
    the top one is a route which is nested within a route while the second is a
    component of the route
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md

  model: function(){
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Brian',
        section: 'wdi'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Jake',
        section: 'wdi-12'
      }
    ];
  }
});
    ```


1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
dont think this is what you were asking for but was unclear

    model: function(){
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Crock Pot',
        manufacturer: 'Farberware',
        price: 40
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Food Processor',
        manufacturer: 'Cuisinart',
        price: 25
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Electric Griddle',
        manufacturer: 'George Foreman Grills',
        price: 15
      },
    ];
  }
});

    ```
